üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
A Google Gemini API Key: You can obtain one for free from the Google AI Studio.
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>


Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure your API Key:
The application requires an API key to communicate with the Gemini API.
Create a new file named .env in the root directory of the project.
Add the following line to the .env file, replacing YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY with your actual key:
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY


Running the App
Once you have completed the setup, you can run the application with this command:
streamlit run app.py


This will launch a local server and open the app in your web browser.
